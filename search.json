It will look slightly different depending on the operating system you use. The screenshot is from a Mac.\n\n\n\nThe R Console\n\n\nAt the bottom of the screen is the command prompt &gt;. Commands are typed at the command prompt and followed by the ENTER key.\nFrom now type all the command you see into R. If you type in an expression, when you hit the ENTER key, the expression will be evaluated and the result returned, for example, lets add 5 and 5 together.\n\n5+5\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\nR is an object-oriented programming language and the basic unit in R is called an object. Objects can store single numbers, columns of data, modelling output, functions and other kinds of information.\n\nThe class of the object determines the way in which commands are executed on an object and the way in which data can be stored by the object. For example, vectors store a single column of data, a matrix can store multiple columns of data and a data frame can store multiple columns of data where the columns may be of different data types (e.g. numbers and text).\nWe can also save our result above into a named object using the assignment operator &lt;- or =. I like the arrow because it points in the direction of the object being created. For example, the following command saves the value 5+5 as an object called myData.\n\n\nmyData &lt;- 5+5\n\n\nYou can view the contents of an object by typing the object name:\n\n\nmyData\n\n\nWhen you hit the RETURN Key, you will see the following output:\n\n\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\nObject names can be made up of letters, numbers and , and _ symbols. A name must start with . or a letter. If it starts with . the second character must not be a number.\nR is case sensitive, so calling mydata is not the same as myData and will generate an error:\n\n\nmydata\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'mydata' not found\n\n\n\nTo see a list of all the named objects you’ve created in R, use the objects function:\n\n\nobjects()\n\n[1] \"myData\"          \"pandoc_dir\"      \"quarto_bin_path\"\n\n\n\nTo delete an object, use the remove function:\n\n\nremove(myData)\n\n\nIf you type and enter an incomplete command, a continuation prompt will appear on the next line: +. You can continue typing the command followed by the ENTER Key.\n\n\nmyData3 &lt;-\n+ 8\n\n\nTo cancel a command at the continuation prompt (or during execution of a command), press the ESC key.\nThe up and down arrow keys can be used to scroll through previous commands.\nComments can be indicated by a hash mark (#) - everything on the line following the hash mark will be ignored by R. This can be after R code on a line or on a separate line as shown below.\n\n\n#I am adding 6+6 and saving it to an object called my.Data\nmy.Data &lt;- 6+6"

This is particularly important as you begin to write series of commands to perform a certain task. One option is to save these commands to text files and copy the relevant commands into R as needed. You can save logical groupings of commands into different text files.\nA better option is to use text editors – one example is RStudio and unlike notepad it allows syntax highlighting of R commands. When an R session is open, RStudio includes an additional menu and toolbar and it allows the user to interact with R by submitting code in whole or in part.\nFrom now on you should start to use RStudio by copying the commands into a R file and then submitting them to R. By doing this you will have a record of the commands you have used. From now you will be using R through RStudio and not the console directly. Over time you will develop a library of code to perform analyses and create graphics.\nThe screenshot below shows RStudio, the top left window shows your code and the bottom left window shows the input and output in R. The top right hand window side shows the objects you have created, for example myData. The bottom left hand corner shows graphics, in this case a histogram, but can also show other useful features such as the help menu.\n\n\n\n\nR Studio"
